                Tripster Life is a Google Chrome extension that 
                will take take users input for their desired 
                destinations for where they would like to go in 
                the world and then display a new image on their 
                tab every day.  The idea is to get stoke excitement 
                and interest in a way that doesnâ€™t involve clicking 
                on a website.  Once the extension is installed they 
                will be served up a new image once a day showing them 
                the images location on a map, the temperature of the 
                location, the weather forecast, the local time and a 
                countdown to the when they leave.  For the desk jockey 
                in cubicle world this a nice one minute respite from 
                their daily work to soak in the excitement of their 
                planned trip.
